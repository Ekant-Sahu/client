                <p>Comprehensive Bike Insurance is a 2 wheeler insurance plan that offers coverage to your bike against different types of damages, total loss, and theft. The Comprehensive Two-wheeler Insurance Policy is a combination of a Third-party Liability Cover and Own Damage Cover for Bike (OD). It provides coverage against accidental damages, fire, natural disasters such as flooding, earthquakes, etc., and manmade disasters such as vandalism, riots, etc.</p>
                <p>The Comprehensive Motorcycle Insurance also covers damages caused to a third partyâ€™s vehicle or property and if somebody is injured or causes third-party death due to an accident. At FinSure, we offer the mandatory Third-party Bike Insurance Policy, a standalone OD Cover, and the full-protection Comprehensive 2-wheeler Insurance Policy. If you have only taken mandatory bike insurance, you can upgrade to the Comprehensive Two-wheeler Insurance Policy during bike insurance renewal.</p>
