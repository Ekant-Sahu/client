                <p>Electric bike insurance in India refers to a two-wheeler insurance plan which provides coverage for electric bikes and scooters. It is also called electric scooter insurance and can cover third-party liabilities and damages to the e-bike depending on the type of policy you purchase and its terms and conditions. If you own an electric bike/scooter, purchasing this insurance policy is mandatory in India to comply with the legal norms. The policy, in general, works like any other insurance cover for two-wheelers.</p>

                <h2>Types of e-bike insurance policies</h2>
                <p>Similar to the petrol-powered two-wheelers, the electric bike insurance cover for EV bikes is of three types.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Third-party Insurance</strong>
                        <p>Provides financial protection against demise or injury to a third person due to an accident caused by your electric bike. And it also covers damages to their property or vehicle. However, it does not provide financial security against damages or losses incurred by your e-bike.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Own Damage Cover</strong>
                        <p>Provides financial protection only against damages or losses incurred by your e-bike. It includes coverage against damages caused by fire, road accidents, manmade or natural causes, theft, and total loss. However, the e-bike insurance does not cover third-party losses.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Comprehensive Insurance</strong>
                        <p>It is a combination of Third-party Insurance and Own Damage cover. Hence, it is the most suitable bike insurance plan for your electric scooter or bike. Like the Own Damage Bike Insurance Cover, you also have the option to include add-ons to enhance the coverage in this plan. Add-ons are subject to availability.</p>
