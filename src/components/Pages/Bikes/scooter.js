                <p>Scooter insurance is basically a two-wheeler insurance plan that can cover third-party liabilities and damages to the scooter, depending on the terms and conditions of the chosen policy. For instance, a Third-party Scooter Insurance Plan (Liability-only Policy) will only cover damages to the third-party property and injury/death of a third party, while a Comprehensive Scooter Insurance Plan will offer all the benefits of the Third-party Liability Policy and cover damages to the scooter.</p>
